break point on a source line
 - use Saruman to read in the Number Line program and find the mapping in the matrix
 - This is the start of the instruction

break point on an address (verified)
 - Need to find the start of the instruction, cannot add a bp to
    the middle of an instruction, as it may just change data or the instr meaning
 - This can be done by mapping addr -> line, line -> addr to find the start of the
    line's instruction and then walking through and disassembling the instructions
    until you find the address, is within the instruction
 - Then take the start of the instruction as the address to add the breakpoint to
 - The size of the instruction should be checked against the size of the breakpoint
    e.g. 0xCC, or ARM 4 byte (intrinsic), to check that the saved amount is the same,
    or greater

break point on an address (unverified)
 I cannot imagine much use for this version as this could just be data
 in which case we wouldn't break
