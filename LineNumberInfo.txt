storing: 
 cc
 for cc
   start, size
   
could use ULEB for the size
and then verify that the start can be sentinal + offset
Then store a header that keeps track of the line -> location in the table

sentinals stored at

if the line is greater than we can store then overwrite the other lines,
rewrite their values & update the header index for those lines

| line7 | line8 | line9     -> | line7 line7 | line9 | line8
e.g. if line7 has a new child, then overwrite line8, rewrite it to the end & update
the header. This still works for n % x sentinals

The sentinals should be stored in the header?

what if one of the offsets is greater than the assumed size, this could be ok with ULEB128,
and just store if we need to parse them completely. This does slightly reduce the max
Actually unlikely to work as the max size would be < uint8_t
So would most likely just parse a ULEB, OR would it be better to be strictly uint16_t or uint32_t?
what about a 16 or 32 bit ULEB?

assume most lines require only one child,
those that don't may amortise with the lines that don't have anything linked
So the header is the size of the lines * the offset into the table (this could be changed?)
